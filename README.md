# Assessment Feedback

## Q - 1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?  
(Please try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)  

**A:** 4-5 hours

## Q - 2. What online resources have you used?  
(My lectures, YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)  

**A:** Lectures, a few YouTube tutorials, and looking at my classmates' GitHubs to see if I was on track.

## Q - 3. Did you need to ask any of your friends for help in solving the problems?  
(If yes, please mention the name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)  

**A:** No one specifically or any specific GitHub more than just a brief glance.

## Q - 4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors?  
(If so, how many questions did you ask, or how many help sessions did you require?)  

**A:** Nope!

## Q - 5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective,  
and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one.  

**A:**  
- I'd rate most questions a **1/5**, with **3 and 5** being a **2/5** due to their complexity.  
- Fairly simple and good-to-know concepts that I’ll have no issue applying in future situations!
